The population of the civil parish at the 2001 Census was 562, reducing to 445 at the 2011 Census.Located at the mouth of the River Aln, the village had a port supporting a small fishing industry and engaging in national and international trade. It was for a time a leading north-east centre for the export of grain and other foodstuffs, especially to Londonand specialised in the import of timber and slate. These activities to some extent shaped the village, as granaries were constructed to store grain, and sawmills and a boatyard established to process wood and build ships.\\nPort activities declined at the end of the 19th century, in part because of the deterioration of the port due to the shifting and silting of the river estuary, in part as trade transferred to the railways. A notable change in the course of the river during a violent storm in 1806 resulted in the loss of the remains of the village's original church and disruption to the functioning of the port and industries.\\nWith the coming of the railways, Alnmouth transformed into a coastal resort complete with one of the earliest English golf courses, a holiday camp, bathing houses, beach huts and spacious sea-view villas. In contemporary times, Alnmouth is a well conserved picturesque coastal resort and tourist attraction, lying within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.","Lng":-1.6129047,"Monday":"","Rating":0,"Website":"","Name":"Alnmouth","Saturday":"","Total_Reviews":0,"Friday":"","Phone":"","Full_Address":"","Tuesday":"","id":7,"Keyword":"St Cuthberts Cross, Alnmouth","City":"","Thursday":"","Subcategory":"","State":"","Sunday":"","Wednesday":"","name":"Alnmouth","Main_Image_URL":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipNbo6GK9TZ4W_iMHgC8vIuqQpfJtnTqMVYGW5_0=w408-h272-k-no","Lat":55.3902223,"Amenities":""},{"Plus_Code":"9CX2+87 Foxton, Alnwick","Zip":"NE66 3BE","Street_Address":"","Category":"Miscellaneous","Email":"","Description":"","Lng":-1.5992973,"Monday":"8am - 3pm","Rating":4.6,"Website":"alnmouthgolfclub.com","Name":"Alnmouth Golf Club","Saturday":"7:30am - 4pm","Total_Reviews":113,"Friday":"8am - 3pm","Phone":"01665 830231","Full_Address":"Foxton Dr, Alnwick NE66 3BE","Tuesday":"8am - 3pm","id":8,"Keyword":"Alnmouth Golf Club, Alnmouth","City":"Foxton Dr","Thursday":"8am - 3pm","Subcategory":"Golf club","State":"Alnwick","Sunday":"7:30am - 4pm","Wednesday":"8am - 3pm","name":"Alnmouth Golf Club","Main_Image_URL":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOoZBR93V8qqEMVaaPVjvW6EfsrrIw2grqgIyMq=w408-h544-k-no","Lat":55.3983524,"Amenities":""},{"Plus_Code":"C78V+6J Alnwick","Zip":"NE66 1NQ","Street_Address":"","Category":"Sightseeing","Email":"","Description":"Alnwick Castle is a castle and country house in Alnwick in the English county of Northumberland.

After passing between the Britons and the Anglo-Saxons three times, the fort came under Anglo-Saxon control in 590. The fort was destroyed by Vikings in 993, and the Normans later built a new castle on the site, which forms the core of the present one. After a revolt in 1095 supported by the castle's owner, it became the property of the English monarch.\\nIn the 17th century, financial difficulties led to the castle deteriorating, but it was restored by various owners during the 18th and 19th centuries. It was finally bought by the Victorian era industrialist William Armstrong, who completed its restoration.

It was enlarged under the ownership of his successor, Edward Haggerston, but suffered severe damage in a fire that burned most of the East wing to the ground. The Haggerstons sheltered Catholic priests within secret tunnels and chambers during the persecutions of the Reformation.In the Second World War, the Ellingham estate was farmed by the Women's Land Army who put the tennis courts into cultivation and used the reception rooms as a food storage centre. From 1955 to 1988 the hall was used a preparatory school for boys aged 5 to 18. It was subsequently bought by property developers but a plan to convert the building into residential flats and houses on the land was usurped by NatWest bank during the crash of 1989, despite being offered 25% interest until the properties were soldthereafter the hall was left standing empty and vulnerable to vandalism and the elements. It was bought in 1995 by Helen and Aidan Ruff, who restored and renovated it to serve as a country house venue for holiday rental, parties, weddings and corporate events. The refurbished building was reopened in 2003. In May 2010, the chapel was gutted by fire.In December 2010, Ellingham Hall found itself bombarded by calls after WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was bailed to stay at its namesake, Ellingham Hall, Norfolk.

The castle was involved both in local feuding and the border wars between England and Scotland. There was a battle between the rival Manners and Heron families outside the walls in 1428, and in 1513 it was briefly captured by King James IV of Scotland during his invasion of England.\\nThe castle passed into the hands of the Crown in 1547 and was garrisoned as part of the border defences, but fell into disrepair and was abandoned as a military fortification after 1603. In the 18th century it ceased to be used as a domestic dwelling and became ruinous. In the 21st century the castle is owned by the Joicey family, but managed by English Heritage.

Nearby villages include Mitford and Pegswood. In the 2011 census, the population of Morpeth was given as 14,017, up from 13,833 in the 2001 census. The earliest record of the town is believed to be from the Neolithic period. The meaning of the town's name is uncertain, but it may refer to its position on the road to Scotland and a murder which occurred on that road. The de Marley family was granted the Barony of Morpeth in c. 1080 and built two castles in the town in the late 11th century and the 13th century. The town was granted its coat of arms in 1552. By the mid 1700s it had become one of the main markets in England, having been granted a market charter in 1199, but the opening of the railways in the 1800s lead the market to decline. The town's history is celebrated in the annual Northumbrian Gathering.\\nMorpeth is governed by Northumberland County Council and Morpeth Town Council. The town is split into three wards \\u2013 North, Kirkhill and Stobhill \\u2013 for the purposes of parish elections. In 2008 the town suffered a severe flood, which was repeated in 2012, resulting in the construction of new flood defences. Morpeth railway station is on the east coast line and a curve to the south of it has caused several rail crashes. Several sports teams compete in Morpeth, with Morpeth Town A.F.C. having been the winner of the FA Vase in 2016. The town hosted its own Olympics from 1873 to 1958. Two middle schools and seven primary schools are situated in Morpeth, as well as several churches of Anglican, Roman Catholic, United Reformed and Methodist denominations. Morpeth's Carlisle Park, the recipient of several awards, contains one of the four floral clocks in England.","Lng":-1.687493,"Monday":"","Rating":0,"Website":"","Name":"Morpeth","Saturday":"","Total_Reviews":0,"Friday":"","Phone":"","Full_Address":"","Tuesday":"","id":173,"Keyword":"Scotch Gill Wood Local Nature Reserve, Morpeth","City":"","Thursday":"","Subcategory":"","State":"","Sunday":"","Wednesday":"","name":"Morpeth","Main_Image_URL":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOZXCbdsNodroWKxM0zkaFsaK-837Ed2wtrO4I=w408-h229-k-no","Lat":55.16875,"Amenities":""},{"Plus_Code":"5887+P7 Morpeth","Zip":"NE61 1PQ","Street_Address":"","Category":"Sightseeing","Email":"","Description":"Morpeth Chantry also known as All Saints Chantry is a Grade I listed building situated adjacent to the site of the ancient bridge across the River Wansbeck at Morpeth, Northumberland.\\nIt was built in about 1296 and served both as a chapel dedicated to All Saints and as a toll house for the river crossing. The duties of the appointed chaplain also included those of schoolmaster.\\nThe suppression of the monasteries by Henry VIII was followed in 1547 by the suppression of chantries by Edward VI and the building was deconsecrated. In 1552 a Royal Charter was granted for the establishment of a free grammar school. The school now known as King Edward VI School occupied the site until a new school was built elsewhere in the Borough in 1859.\\nThereafter the building was occupied for a variety of commercial purposes including a mineral water factory. In 1974 the neglected and deteriorating property was acquired by the local authority and after restoration and refurbishment was opened for community use in 1984.

The gardens have a long history under the Dukes of Northumberland, but fell into disrepair until revived at the turn of the 21st century. The garden now features various themed plantings designed around a central water cascade. The revival of the gardens led to several public disputes between the Duchess of Northumberland and various garden experts concerning preservation and the use of public funds. The garden now belongs to a charitable trust, which is separate from Northumberland Estates, although the 12th Duke of Northumberland donated the 42-acre (17 ha) site and contributed \\u00a39 million towards redevelopment costs.","Lng":-1.700515,"Monday":"10am - 4pm","Rating":4.6,"Website":"alnwickgarden.com","Name":"The Alnwick Garden","Saturday":"10am - 4pm","Total_Reviews":3036,"Friday":"10am - 4pm","Phone":"01665 511350","Full_Address":"Denwick Lane, Alnwick NE66 1YU","Tuesday":"10am - 4pm","id":248,"Keyword":"The Alnwick Garden, Alnwick","City":"Denwick Lane","Thursday":"10am - 4pm","Subcategory":"Garden","State":"Alnwick","Sunday":"10am - 4pm","Wednesday":"10am - 4pm","name":"The Alnwick Garden","Main_Image_URL":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOGd4fR1itYlGaSzrupIzo2Dq0lEKZ3wE5zBM8x=w408-h266-k-no","Lat":55.414098,"Amenities":""},{"Plus_Code":"C77X+QJ Alnwick","Zip":"NE66 1YU","Street_Address":"","Category":"Shopping","Email":"","Description":"","Lng":-1.7008954,"Monday":"10am - 6pm","Rating":4.7,"Website":"alnwickgarden.com","Name":"The Alnwick Garden Plant Centre and Nursery","Saturday":"10am - 6pm","Total_Reviews":20,"Friday":"10am - 6pm","Phone":"01665 511350","Full_Address":"Denwick Lane, Alnwick NE66 1YU","Tuesday":"10am - 6pm","id":249,"Keyword":"The Alnwick Garden, Alnwick","City":"Denwick Lane","Thursday":"10am - 6pm","Subcategory":"Garden centre","State":"Alnwick","Sunday":"10am - 6pm","Wednesday":"10am - 6pm","name":"The Alnwick Garden Plant Centre and Nursery","Main_Image_URL":"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/p\/AF1QipOhYfcDeJzHRPXloA5jSCRlnKJwRLQA3fwQ7wXR=w408-h354-k-no","Lat":55.4144118,"Amenities":""},{"Plus_Code":"8CFC+P6 Amble, Morpeth","Zip":"NE65 0PE","Street_Address":"Percy Dr","Category":"Food and Drink","Email":"","Description":"Northumberland's newest pub with rooms The Amble Inn is open all day, every day for delicious, homemade pub food from 7.30am - 9.00pm.
